# Monolithic to Microservices Architecture using Cloud Pak for Applications

In this tutorial , we will learn how to use Cloud Pak for Applications to break down our monolithic application (Core Banking) implemented in Node.js into microservices.  

## Cloud Pak for Applications:
The IBM Cloud Pak™ for Applications provides a complete and consistent experience to speed development of applications built for Kubernetes, using agile DevOps processes.

Running on Red Hat® OpenShift®, IBM Cloud Pak for Applications provides a hybrid, multicloud foundation built on open standards, enabling workloads and data to run anywhere. It integrates two main opensource platforms Kabanero(https://kabanero.io/) and Appsody(https://appsody.dev/).



## Prerequisites:

To complete the steps in this tutorial, you need to:
1.[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) on your local machine.

2.Install VS code [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) set up for local development.

3.Create Cloud Pak for Applications service from here

## Steps:
1. [Clone the application & understand the architecture of monolithic application](#1-clone-the-application)
2. [Let's understand how to break down our monolithic application]
3. [How to initialize and do local development using Codewind in Visual Studio](#2-clone-the-application)
4. [Intialize Tekton and integrate with our Github repository]
5. [Scale the application on your needs ]
6. [Check if the microservices are up and running]
